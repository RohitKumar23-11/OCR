# PaddleOCR Study & Training Workflow

This repository demonstrates a **complete PaddleOCR workflow**:
- Review PP-OCR architecture (detector â†’ angle classifier â†’ recognizer).
- Convert datasets into PP-OCR formats for detection & recognition.
- Train lightweight models in **Colab/Kaggle notebooks**.
- Document results with PDF report and diagrams.
